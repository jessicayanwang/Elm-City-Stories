# Elm-City-Stories-ASA DataFest

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our award-winning project at the ASA DataFest Toronto, 2022. Our team was honored with the "Best Insight" award for our analysis on the educational game "Elm City Stories." Elm City Stories was a game developed for researchers at the Play2Prevent Lab within the Yale School of Medicine.

## Elm City Stories

"Elm City Stories" is an educational game designed to enlighten players about the challenges and consequences associated with drug use. Set in the fictional Elm City, players journey through diverse narratives, encountering real-life scenarios that demand critical decision-making skills. As players progress through different chapters, they face challenges that not only test their knowledge about drugs but also hone their ability to resist peer pressure and make informed decisions. The game, with its captivating stories and lifelike scenarios, aims to educate its players about the perils of drug use in a way that's engaging and relatable.

## Project Overview

We embarked on a mission to understand how a player's gaming experience with "Elm City Stories" correlates to their efficacy in resisting drug use. Our objective was to determine the educational effectiveness of the game and gather actionable insights for future game development.

### Key Achievements:

- **Linear Mixed-Effect Models:** Leveraged these models to establish a relationship between a player's game experience and their ability to resist drugs.
- **Correlation Graphs:** Visualized correlations that offer a more intuitive understanding of players' reactions and outcomes after playing the game.
- **Educational Effectiveness Analysis:** Evaluated the educational efficacy of each chapter of the game, pinpointing areas of strength and potential improvement.
- **Player Characteristics Analysis:** Identified the unique characteristics of players who benefitted the most from the game, providing direction for targeted future development.
